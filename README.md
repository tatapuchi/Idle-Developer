# Idle Developer


## Plan

### Setting
You are a developer starting out on your IT journey, you will be learning frameworks, languages and tools that will allow you to earn money in order to obtain the tools you need to get more money and StackOverflow fame. You choose a language to start off with and start learning it, learning is accelerated by taps, once a learning session is completed, you get a certain amount of XP for it, the more completed learning sessions, the faster you learn but more XP needed. XP for a certain language can be traded in for frameworks for the language, which follows the same tap tap learning pattern.
