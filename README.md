# Idle Developer


### Setting
You are a developer starting out on your IT journey, you will be learning frameworks, languages and tools that will allow you to earn money in order to obtain the tools you need to get more money and StackOverflow fame. You choose a language to start off with and start learning it, learning is accelerated by taps, once a learning session is completed, you get a certain amount of XP for it, the more completed learning sessions, the faster you learn but more XP needed. Upon reaching an XP cap you increase your level in that language/framework/tool. XP for a certain language can be traded in for frameworks for the language, which follows the same tap tap learning pattern.

Once you have enough levels in a language or framework, you can also apply for a job, allowing you to earn coins. Coins can be used to buy tools that buff your developer, such as proprietary IDEs like IntelliJ Ultimate, Adobe Products, a PC, PC component upgrades, Monitors, more PCs, etc.
