# Welcome to Idle Developer

Greetings,
This is the official site for Idle Developer.

The game is currently being built using Xamarin, and a number of useful plugins.

We are currently looking for an artist, with experience in Adobe AfterEffects as we are planning on using Lottie for animations.

Currently, we are not monetizing the game (Microtransactions/Ads) but are looking to possibly include github sponsorships/donations as a way to make some money
